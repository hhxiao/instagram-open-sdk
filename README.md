# Instagram Open SDK

Go SDK for Instagram that uses same REST/GraphQL that web client does instead of official api.

## Why

Because I found Instagrams app preview process painful and needles.

## How

SDK uses same api the official web client does so you will need instagram account to use this. Now instead of access token and client id this SDK authenticates in same way the web client does, by using cookies.

## Status

This project is still in WIP state so the api changes are inevitable.
